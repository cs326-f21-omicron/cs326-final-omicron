# Setup

Whenever a user enters the website they will be directed to the landing.html page where they are two options. If they are new to the website, they will be directed to the signup page where they will enter basic information about themselves as well as certain interests in order to make recommendations. After signing up logging back in, the default page the users will see is the home/recommendation page. Here users can see recommendations of friends who have similar interests and hobbies. The user can also view messages sent and received amongst other users on the site in a table like directory. Users can update their user profile on a separate page where they can edit their credentials and basic information as well as add and remove hobbies. The server will process requests for editing their user information by accessing and updating the database API and then rendering the updated items on the page. The database will in whole store a list of users who are signed up on the website with their bio, hobby/interests list,and friends and messages.
